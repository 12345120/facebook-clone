Twitch <case study> 
- recommended channels (left pannel) + Top Search Bar --> Layout kind of thing
- go back and forth between pages: 
  - under Home tab bar --> before videos are loaded, loading skeleton shown 
  - previous person's background, and when data fetched, swtiches background to current
  - item switch animations on left pannel (if same person on list but at different index, swap animation)
- if no previous page: 
  - under Home tab bar --> before videos are loaded, loading skeleton shown 
  - purple background (default) --> set background
- from this, I think it is evident that the page is delivered by CSR (client side rendering)
- I think CSR beats SSR on loading time? 
  - first show the page with static content 
  - load (fetch) data (main video + list of videos under Home + background) on client side 
  - can show the static content instantly while data is being fetched 
  - SSR doesn't serve static content, takes loading time before page is shown 
    - blank screen shown until page is loaded ig?
