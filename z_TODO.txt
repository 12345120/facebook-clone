<TODO>:
- check network tab on chrome debugger and see if firebase file with project data is included 
  even when you are not logged in by OAuth
  
- need security rules for logged in users 
  - limit post creates 
- rate limit (Fireship) 
  - but I need request.auth for that 
  - (user doc with docID as uid --> so that no malicious user can imitate 
    user creation) (with my curernt securty code w/o request.auth, anyone can)

- For now, blocked all write requests to firestore (meaning no post allowed)
